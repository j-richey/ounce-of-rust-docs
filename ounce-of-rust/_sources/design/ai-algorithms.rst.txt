    AI (Artificial Intelligence) Algorithms
    * Depth first search tree
    * Checks the state of the board: looks for end games: win, tie (cats game), loss
    * Picks the move that results in the highest score, e.g. win, then cats game, then loss
    * If scores are equal, picks random spot of the equal spots (so game appears more random)
    * This algorithm is perfect, thus toning down the difficulty involves the AI
      randomly not looking at a path. The probability of not going down a path
      is based on the difficulty setting.
