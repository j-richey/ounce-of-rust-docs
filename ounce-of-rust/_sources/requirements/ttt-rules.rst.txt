Rules of Tic Tac Toe
####################

The rules for Tic Tac Toe are as follows:

1. Play occurs on 3 x 3 grid. The grid starts empty with no marks.
#. The first player places their mark in one of the grid's squares. Traditionally,
   the mark is the letter *X*.
#. The second player places their mark in one of the grid's empty squares. A square
   that already contains a mark cannot be updated or altered. Traditionally, the
   second player uses the letter *O* as their mark.
#. Turns alternate between the players until the game is over.
#. The game ends in a win when one of the players gets three of their marks in
   a line. That is: they have three marks in a row, column, or diagonally.
   Examples of winning games are shown in :numref:`fig-example-wining-games`.
