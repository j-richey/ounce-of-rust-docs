<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Scope of the Game<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-of-the-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tic-tac-toe is a game of strategy where two players, X and O, take turns placing
their mark in a 3 x 3 gird. The first player to get three marks in a row,
column, or diagonal wins the game.</p>
<p>FoxXO is a unique take on the classic game of tic-tac-toe. Players of
all ages battle the computer or each other in a variety of stunning environments.
Each environment tells part of the story of tic-tac-toe from the past, present,
and future. Each environment has a strong visual theme and complementary
soundtrack.</p>
<p>FoxXO is free, open source, and no contains no annoying advertisements. It
runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The game launches Summer 2020.</p>

<p>The main deliverable of this project is a tic-tac-toe game for Windows, Mac,
and Linux. This project is the follow-up to the Ounce of Rust project <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ounceofrust" id="id2">2</a>
that resulted in the creation of a Rust based tic-tac-toe logic library,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open_ttt_lib</span></code>. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#opentttlib" id="id3">3</a></p>
<p>In addition to creating a fun game, the project provides more hands on experience
using Rust and is a showcase for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open_ttt_lib</span></code>.</p>

<p>FoxXO is and will always be free, open source, and contain no advertisements or
trackers. The game is released under a permissive open source license and its
code is available from a public repository such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Many of today’s games casual games are released for free, but include
questionable monetization models such as microtransactions, pay-to-win schemes,
advertisements, and personal data harvesters. FoxXO stands apart from
these games by respecting players who choose to spend their valuable time
playing the game.</p>

<p>Playing tic-tac-toe in a variety of environments is a large part of what sets
FoxXO apart from other tic-tac-toe games. The game is designed such that
developers can easily add new environments. This allows developers to focus
their time and effort creating stunning environments. Additionally, this
lowers the barrier of entry for users who are interested in modifying the game.
Finally, an easily modifiable code base allows quick turnaround of future
releases of the game.</p>

<p>The development team creating FoxXO is new to the Rust programming language
and the available Rust libraries for game development. To help mitigate this
risk, a throwaway prototype game is created early in the project that explores
various technical aspects.</p>
<p>Using the lessons learned from the prototype also helps the development team
design a code base that is easily expandable and modifiable per the above
objective.</p>

<p>Tic-tac-toe is a game of strategy where two players, X and O, take turns placing
their mark in a 3 x 3 gird. The rules for tic-tac-toe used for each game mode
are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Play occurs on a board composed of a 3 x 3 grid of squares. The board starts
empty with no marks.</p></li>
<li><p>The first player places their mark in one of the grid’s squares. Traditionally,
the mark is the letter <em>X</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The second player places their mark in one of the grid’s empty squares. A square
that already contains a mark cannot be updated or altered. Traditionally, the
second player uses the letter <em>O</em> as their mark.</p></li>
<li><p>Turns alternate between the players until the game is over.</p></li>
<li><p>The first player to get three of their marks in a line wins the game.
That is: they have three marks in a row, column, or diagonally.
Examples of winning games are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-example-wining-games"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 2.1</span></a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id2">

that contributed to the win. Notice that it is possible to get multiple
sets of three marks in a row.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>The game ends in a draw, known as a <span class="target" id="index-1"></span>cat’s game, if no more empty
squares remain and a player has failed to get three marks in a line.
Examples of cat’s games are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-example-cats-games"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 2.2</span></a>.</p>

</div>
</li>
<li><p>The steps above are repeated for a series of games. The starting player
alternates between games. For example, the second game player <em>O</em> gets to
make the first move.</p></li>

<span id="index-2"></span><h2><span class="section-number">2.2. </span>Single-player Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#single-player-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In single-player mode the player battles a computer controlled opponent. There
are three difficulty settings: <strong>easy</strong>, <strong>medium</strong>, and <strong>hard</strong>.</p>
<p>Easy difficulty is targeted at players who are new to tic-tac-toe and/or
computer games. The computer picks random squares allowing players to learn the
game’s controls and rules.</p>
<p>Medium difficulty is for players who have some experience with tic-tac-toe. The
computer provides a challenge to the player but games are still winnable.</p>
<p>At hard difficulty the computer plays almost perfect games. The player must
capitalize on rare mistakes made by the computer to win. This is the recommended
difficulty for experienced tic-tac-toe players.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-player-mode">
<span id="ref-gameplay-two-player-mode"></span><h2><span class="section-number">2.3. </span>Two Player Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#two-player-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In two player mode two players take turns placing their marks according to the
rules of tic-tac-toe previously described.</p>

<p>A speedrun mode provides an additional challenge for experienced players.
Players battle a flawless computer opponent through ten environments completing
the games as fast as possible. At the end of the run the total time is
displayed along with the previous best times. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#timecalculation" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>The player is disqualified and the run halted if the player loses a game.
Since the computer opponent never makes a mistake, each game in the speedrun
ends in a cat’s game. In other words, each speedrun requires the same total
number of moves to complete.</p>
<p>Unnecessary animations are disabled in speedrun mode so they do not get in the
way of the speedup gameplay. Additionally, speedrun mode has its own dramatic
music that replaces the music tracks of each environment — environments are
played so fast there is not sufficient time to appreciate their individual sound
tracks.</p>

<h1><span class="section-number">3. </span>User Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#user-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This chapter describes the user interface of FoxXO. This includes the main
game board, controls, and all game menus.</p>
<div class="section" id="game-board">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.1. </span>Game Board<a class="headerlink" href="#game-board" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The game board is where players spend the majority of their time. Additionally,
the game loads directly to this view ensuring players get to gameplay as quickly
as possible without menus getting in the way. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#firstview" id="id1">1</a> A concept drawing of
the game board is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ui-game-board"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 3.1</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The game board contains the following items of interest:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The marks and grid. The appearance of these depend on the current environment
being played. However, the marks for all environments use the same center
point and have the same selectable hot spot. This ensures consistency between
environments when using the mouse.</p></li>
<li><p>The background of the game board depends on the current environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The hamburger button opens the <a class="reference internal" href="#ref-ui-main-menu"><span class="std std-ref">Main Menu</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Status text indicates who gets to make the next move and the outcome of
the game. Once the game is over buttons to play the next game or return to
the menu also appear in this area. The text is outlined or shaded such that
it is visible over any possible background.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A major focus of the game is playing tic-tac-toe in variety of stunning
environments that control how the marks, grid, and background look. Thus, a
minimalist approach is used for the game board view. The only UI widgets are a
menu button and some status text.</p>

</div>
<p>Items of interest are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The speedrun status display prominently shows the elapsed time of the run.
This helps give the player a sense of urgency and lets them see if they are
on track to get a best time.</p></li>
<li><p>Splits for each game are additionally displayed. Dashes or other marks are
used for games that have yet to be played. This allows players to quickly
visually gauge how many games remain.</p></li>
<li><p>Opening the game’s menu ends the run. The run is disqualified.</p></li>
<li><p>Status text indicates the current turn. If the player loses a game, the
status text notes that the run is disqualified and the player is invited
to try the run again or return to the Speedrun menu. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#speedrunloss" id="id2">2</a></p></li>

<p>The marks and grid are scratched into the bathroom stall divider. This

line but it takes several attempts to form a line thus there are “whiskers”

malformed O’s.</p>

<p>When the game ends in a win, the wining marks illuminate very brightly and
even change color. The grid takes on a uniform illumination. A cats game or
single player loss results in the grid to go dark and all the marks to go
back to a mild illumination, as if the power has been cut and they are
slowly fading away.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">5.5. </span>Future Enhancements<a class="headerlink" href="#future-enhancements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are some additional features that can be considered for future versions of
the game. These are described below.</p>
<div class="section" id="network-multiplayer">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.5.1. </span>Network Multiplayer<a class="headerlink" href="#network-multiplayer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Network based multiplayer allows players to remotely battle each other. Network
based multiplayer is preferable to local multiplayer in many situations such as
friends who live in different states, office environments, or players trying to
avoid a zombie apocalypse. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#covid19" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>There are different network multiplayer modes.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Normal</dt><dd><p>The normal mode is <a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#ref-gameplay-two-player-mode"><span class="std std-ref">Two Player Mode</span></a> but played over the
network instead of locally.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Speedrun</dt><dd><p>Speedrun multiplayer is a two player version of <a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#ref-gameplay-speed-run-mode"><span class="std std-ref">Speedrun Mode</span></a>
where the players compete to see who can play 10 games the fastest without
loosing. If a player wins one of the games, the speedrun is over and that
player is the winner. If all ten games are cat’s games, then the player with
the fastest overall time wins.</p>
</dd>
<dt>King of the Hill</dt><dd><p>King of the hill allows more than two people to battle. From the pool of
available players two are chosen to battle. The round consists of playing
two games. The player first to win any game, or in the case of all cat’s
games has the fastest overall time, wins the round. They stay in the game
and another challenger is selected from the pool of players. This continues
until a victory condition is met, such as the first player to win X number
of rounds.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Regardless of the mode, the players always see the same environment to ensure
a consistent play experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="achievements">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.5.2. </span>Achievements<a class="headerlink" href="#achievements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Achievements provide players goals outside the usual <a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#document-gameplay"><span class="doc">Gameplay</span></a> rules.
These provide more depth to the game and encourage players to try different
approaches to the game.</p>
<p>A future enhancement is to add achievements to the game. Some achievement might
include the following.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Win a game</p></li>
<li><p>Play a game in every environment</p></li>
<li><p>Win a hard game</p></li>
<li><p>Win a game on every environment</p></li>
<li><p>Win a hard game on every environment</p></li>
<li><p>Complete a speed run</p></li>
<li><p>Complete a speed run in less than X seconds</p></li>
<li><p>Complete a speed run in less than 1 second!!</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="additional-environments">
<h3><span class="section-number">5.5.3. </span>Additional Environments<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-environments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A major focus of FoxXO is the ability to play tic-tac-toe in a variety
of <a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#document-environments"><span class="doc">Environments</span></a>. Future versions of the game can add even more
environments. Some environments to consider are listed below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Lasers. Perhaps a laser cutter or some other use of lasers.</p></li>
<li><p>Shower door or bathroom mirror.</p></li>
<li><p>Futuristic dystopian or cyber punk theme.</p></li>
<li><p>Some playgrounds have a 3x3 grid of squares for playing tic-tac-toe.</p></li>
<li><p>Winter / snow / frozen lake theme.</p></li>
<li><p>Food theme.</p></li>
<li><p>Light board, like those found in ships or submarines.</p></li>
<li><p>OXO oscilloscope throwback theme.</p></li>
<li><p>Metal or glass forge with lots of glowing hot liquids.</p></li>
<li><p>Clone of James’ 2004 Tic Tac Toe.</p></li>

<h1><span class="section-number">6. </span>Technical Design<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The technical design of FoxXO is described in this chapter.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The Technical Design chapter is intentionally incomplete in this version
of the game design document. This chapter is pending completion of the
throwaway prototype so the lessons learned during the prototyping phase
can help inform the various design decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="throwaway-prototype">
<h2><span class="section-number">6.1. </span>Throwaway Prototype<a class="headerlink" href="#throwaway-prototype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The throwaway prototype fulfills the
<a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#ref-objective-build-risk-reduction-prototype"><span class="std std-ref">Build Risk Reduction Prototype</span></a> objective. The development
team is new to the Rust game development ecosystem; the prototype allows us to
explore various techniques and come up with a design that fulfills the game
requirements listed in this document.</p>
<p>Technical aspects that are explored in the prototyping phase are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Buttons, menus, and other GUI components as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#document-gui"><span class="doc">User Interface</span></a>
chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>User input from a mouse and keyboard. Includes determining the location of
mouse clicks.</p></li>
<li><p>Camera, scene, and window management. E.g. looking at draw order and window
resize behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing bitmap textures. Many environments make use of textures for their
backgrounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing marks and the gird for environments like the
<a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#ref-environment-blueprint"><span class="std std-ref">Blueprint</span></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#ref-environment-chalkboard"><span class="std std-ref">Chalkboard</span></a>.
Perhaps these have lines that could be generated with vector type graphics
or bitmaps that follow paths?</p></li>
<li><p>Animations or sprints. Includes ability to adjust animations speed. Many
environments animate drawing of the marks or a line through the winning marks.</p></li>
<li><p>Sound FX and music. Includes cross fading between tracks and knowing the
length sound FX.</p></li>
<li><p>Lighting, blurring, and other special FX. For example, the
<a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#ref-environment-neon-lights"><span class="std std-ref">Neon Lights</span></a> environment makes heavy use of lighting.
Investigate using shaders to power these effects.</p></li>
<li><p>Particle systems. They might make a nice touch to many environments such as
sparks when the <a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#ref-environment-neon-lights"><span class="std std-ref">Neon Lights</span></a> turn on or showing chalk
dust from the <a class="reference internal" href="singlepage.html#ref-environment-chalkboard"><span class="std std-ref">Chalkboard</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to save and load structured data. This is needed for the user
options and speedrun best times.</p></li>
<li><p>Internalization support.</p></li>
<li><p>Run the prototype on Windows, Mac, and Linux to address any platform
specific issues.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As the name suggests, the prototype is discarded once the team has explored the
technical aspects in question. The prototype is not published to crates.io
and platform specific packages are not created for the prototype. Instead, the
lessons learned are documented in this chapter so a comprehensive production
application can be built.</p>
