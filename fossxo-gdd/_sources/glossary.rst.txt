    asset
        A game asset is a sound, texture, font, model, or other data used by
        the game.

    background music
        Background music is a type of music that is not intended to be the
        primary focus of listeners. When described as the type of music for an
        :term:`environment`, it indicates the environment's music is not a main
        focus of the environment.

    cat's game
        Term used when a game of tic-tac-toe ends in a draw where there is no winner.

    component
        A component contains the data for one aspect of a game object. Component
        examples include color, position, or mark type.

    ECS
        Acronym for :term:`entity component system`.

    entity
        An entity represents a single object in the game. Entities by themselves
        do not store data, instead they identify the collection of
        :term:`components <component>` belonging to the object. Entity examples
        include the marks on the board or an AI player.

    entity component system
        An architecture pattern often used in game engines where
        :term:`entities <entity>` define the game's objects.
        :term:`Components <component>` store the actual data.
        :term:`Systems <system>` contain the logic that operates on the data.

    environment
        An environment is a unique setting or location where tic-tac-toe is
        played.

    hand drawn
        Hand drawn is a style of line that is wavy and imprecise.

    open source software
        Open source software is software whose source code is available for others
        to study, modify, and redistribute.

    Rust programming language
        Rust is a systems programming language with a focus on safety and speed.

    RustConf
         RustConf is the annual Rust developers conference.

    speedrun
        A speed run is a play-though of a video game where the go is to complete
        the game as fast as possible.

    system
        Systems contain the game's logic. Each system is executed every game
        loop over a collection of :term:`components <component>`.

    throwaway prototype
        A prototype is a version of software that is created to demonstrate core
        features or techniques of a software application. A throwaway prototype
        is discarded once the features or techniques have been demonstrated.
        Throwaway prototypes allow for rapid experimentation with low risk.
