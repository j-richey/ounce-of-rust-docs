Game States

A game state is a general and global part of the game. The active state is
updated every game loop, has access to the world's entities and resources, and
can receive events. States can also request a transition to a different state.

.. index:: State trait

===========
State Trait
===========
In Amethyst states implement the `State trait <https://docs.amethyst.rs/stable/amethyst/trait.State.html>`__.
A summary of the State trait is shown in :numref:`uml-state-trait`.

..  _uml-state-trait:
..  uml::
    :caption: Notable methods provided by the State trait.

    !include rust_types.uml
    hide empty members

    trait(State) {
        +on_start(StateData)
        +on_stop(StateData)
        +on_pause(StateData)
        +on_resume(StateData)
        +handle_event(StateData, EventData) -> Trans
        +update(StateData) -> Trans
    }

Each method is provided a ``StateData`` structure that provide's access to the
world's entities and resources. Additionally, ``handle_event()`` is provided an
``EventData`` enum, shown in :numref:`uml-event-data-enum`, that aggregates the
different types of events available to the states.

..  _uml-event-data-enum:
..  uml::
    :caption: Event data available to states.

    !include rust_types.uml
    hide empty members

    enum(EventData) {
        Window(WindowEvent)
        Ui(UiEvent)
        Input(InputEvent)
        Player(PlayerEvent)
    }

The window, UI, and input events are generated by various Amethyst subsystems.
The remaining variants hold custom events generated by the game that states wish
wish to receive.

The state diagram in :numref:`uml-game-state-diagram` shows each state and their
state transitions. [#screenflowchart]_

.. index:: game state
.. _ref-game-state:

==========
Game State
==========
The game state is used for :ref:`ref-gameplay-single-player-mode` and
:ref:`ref-gameplay-two-player-mode` games. The responsibilities of this state
are:

*   Spawn the player and AI opponent entities for playing the game.
*   Handle player events for when marks are placed.
*   Manage the game resource.
*   Show the game environment with the :ref:`ref-environments-resource`.
*   Show the :ref:`ref-ui-game-board` widgets including the menu button and
    status text.
*   Navigate to the main menu state.

When the game state is started, the options to use are provided. This includes
if the game is single-player or multiplayer. For single-player, this is the
difficulty level and if the player is using X or O marks.


.. index:: speedrun game state
.. _ref-speedrun-game-state:

===================
Speedrun Game State
===================
The speedrun game state is used for :ref:`ref-gameplay-speed-run-mode` games.
[#speedrunstatedifference]_ The responsibilities of this state are:

*   Spawn the player and AI opponent entities for playing the game.
*   Handle player events for when marks are placed.
*   Manage the game resource.
*   Keep track of the total speedrun time and time for each game.
*   Show the :ref:`ref-ui-speedrun-game-board` widgets including the menu
    button and status text.
*   Navigate to the best time menu state providing the results of the speedrun.
    The results include a successful game along with the run's time, a
    lost game, or an aborted game from the player opening the menu.


.. index:: loading state

=============
Loading State
=============
The loading state is the first state run when the game starts. The
responsibilities are:

*   Show the :ref:`ref-ui-loading-screen` widgets.
*   Queue the resources to load with asset loader.
*   Monitor and optionally report the loading progress.
*   Launch the game state when resource loading is complete. The
    single player game options last used are provided. [#firstgamesettings]_

The loading state asks the :ref:`ref-environments-resource` and any other
resources to queue the assets that need loaded. It then monitors the loading
progress and transitions to the game state when complete.


.. index:: main menu state
..  _ref-main-menu-state:

===============
Main Menu State
===============
The main menu state allows uses to navigate to the other states.
Responsibilities include:

*   Show the :ref:`ref-ui-main-menu` widgets.
*   Navigate to the single-player menu state.
*   Launch the game state with the multiplayer game flag.
*   Navigate to the options menu state.
*   Navigate to the credits menu state.
*   Open the game's user manual in an external browser.
*   Go to the quit state to exit the game.


.. index:: single-player menu state
.. _ref-single-player-menu-state:

========================
Single-player Menu State
========================
The single-player menu state shows the UI for configuring single-player games.
The responsibilities are:

*   Show the :ref:`ref-ui-single-player` menu widgets.
*   Launch the :ref:`ref-game-state` providing the single-player options
    selected by the player.
*   Navigate to the :ref:`ref-speedrun-menu-state` providing the player mark option.
*   Go back to the :ref:`ref-main-menu-state`.


.. index:: speedrun menu state
.. _ref-speedrun-menu-state:

===================
Speedrun Menu State
===================
The speedrun menu state is the entry point to speed run games. The
responsibilities are:

*   Show the :ref:`ref-ui-speedrun` menu widgets.
*   Query best speed run times from the :ref:`ref-user-data-file`.
*   Launch the speedrun game state using the the player mark option.
*   Go to the best time menu state if the user got a best time. The user's time
    and other speedrun information is provided.
*   Go back to the single-player menu state.

When the speedrun menu state is started, it is optionally provided the result of
the speedrun game. It uses this information to know if it should show the
instructional text, show the game results, or navigate to the best time menu.


.. index:: speedrun best time menu state
.. _ref-speedrun-best-time-menu-state:

=============================
Speedrun Best Time Menu State
=============================
The speedrun best time menu state allows users to view and record a best
speedrun time. The responsibilities are:

*  Show the speed run best time dialog widgets described in the
   :ref:`ref-ui-speedrun` menu.
*  Save the best time information to the :ref:`ref-user-data-file`.
*  Navigate to the speedrun menu state.


.. index:: credits menu state
.. _ref-credits-menu-state:

==================
Credits Menu State
==================
The credits menu state shows the game's credits along with demoing the various
games environments. The responsibilities are:

*   Show the :ref:`ref-ui-credits` menu widgets.
*   Open the game's licence compliance information contained in the user manual
    in an external browser.
*   Show different in progress games.
*   Go back to the main menu state.

The credits menu demonstrates the various game environments. It does this by
creating two AI players that battle while occasionally switching the current
environment using the ref:`ref-environments-resource`.


.. index:: options menu state
.. _ref-options-menu-state:

==================
Options Menu State
==================
The options menu state shows the various options related widgets and saves the
games options. Its responsibilities are:

*   Show the :ref:`ref-ui-options` menu widgets.
*   Apply the user provided options and save the
    :ref:`ref-game-configuration-file` to disk.
*   Allow resetting options to default values.
*   Go back to the main menu state.


..  rubric:: Footnotes

..  [#screenflowchart] The game state diagram is similar, but not identical, to
      the :ref:`ref-ui-screen-flowchart` shown in :numref:`uml-screen-flowchart`.
      Some notable differences include how the speedrun game state always
      transitions back to the speedrun menu state.

..  [#speedrunstatedifference] At first glance the speedrun game state has
      similar responsibilities the game state. However, the speedrun games use
      different rules, show additional widgets, and transition to different
      states. Thus it this mode gets its own state.

..  [#firstgamesettings] The :ref:`ref-ui-game-board` section further describes
      the behavior of the game when first started.
