<p>One of the main defining features of FoxXO over other tic-tac-toe games is the
use of multiple environments. Each environment has a strong visual theme and
complementary soundtrack. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#hiddenfox" id="id1">1</a></p>
<div class="section" id="environment-selection">
<h2><span class="section-number">4.1. </span>Environment Selection<a class="headerlink" href="#environment-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each game takes place on a different environment. Environments are selected using
a shuffling algorithm. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#shuffelalgorithms" id="id2">2</a> This ensures players get to
experience each environment in a random order.</p>

<p class="rubric">Marks and Grid</p>
<p>The blueprint uses white text for the marks and white lines for the grid.</p>
<p>The grid is a series of empty boxes. The interior lines are more prominent
than the exterior lines.</p>
<p>Hovering over an empty square shows a dotted version of the mark that would
be drawn. Clicking places the mark without further animation.</p>
<p>Winning the game causes a “Winning Marks” label to be placed with arrows
pointing to the corresponding marks.</p>
<p class="rubric">Background Scenery</p>
<p>The background is predominantly deep blue. Additional, details are included
in white.</p>
<p>There is a title block with the game’s name, author, version number, etc.</p>
<p>Measurement lines indicate the unit less distance between features.</p>
<p>The grid, squares, marks, etc are pointed to by arrows with labels.

<p class="rubric">Marks and Grid</p>
<p>The marks and grid are dark graphite from a #2 pencil. Each mark is
slightly different and the grid lines are not perfectly straight to give
it a hand drawn look. Likewise, mark placement is animated like one writing
an X or O while a corresponding pencil sound FX is played.</p>
<p>A line is drawn through the winning marks.</p>
<p class="rubric">Background Scenery</p>
<p>The background consists of notebook or engineering paper. Notebook paper is
white with gray or blue lines. Often times there also a vertical red margin
line. Engineering paper is yellow with gray grid lines.</p>
<p>There are doodles, text, or other drawings to give the environment character.
The engineering paper is more likely to have nerdy drawings.</p>

<p class="rubric">Marks and Grid</p>
<p>The marks and grid are created from blue or red ink. Like the
<em>Notebook Paper and Pencil</em> environment, each mark is hand drawn with
corresponding animations and sound FX.</p>
<p>A line is drawn through the winning marks.</p>
<p class="rubric">Background Scenery</p>
<p>Various bits of scrap paper are used for the background. This can include
but is not limited to bank deposit slip, various store receipts, or any
other paper someone might have in their purse.</p>
<p>Text on the paper should be gray, faded black, or otherwise not interfere
with the visibility of the marks.</p>
<p class="rubric">Music Theme</p>
<p>Something with a gospel / church vibe</p>
<p class="rubric">Additional Details</p>
<p>The mark / grid color and the background image is randomly selected each
time the environment is played. Blue and red ink is used so the marks stand
out from the background.</p>
<p>The inspiration from this environment comes from me not paying attention in
church and drawing on scrap paper my mom happened to have.</p>

<p>The marks and grid are created from luminescent orange, pink and / or blue
neon lights. Selecting a square causes the mark to illuminate with a
flickering animation and an electric buzzing sound FX.</p>
<p>All winning marks flash on and off with a mild electric buzz sound FX.</p>
<p>When the environment first loads in non-speedrun mode the lights are not
illuminated. Then the grid flickers on as if the transformer is starting to
fail.</p>
<p class="rubric">Background Scenery</p>
<p>The background is a brick wall holding the neon lights. The wall is
illuminated by the lights. E.g. when a mark is selected the brick wall
behind the mark gains some illumination as shown in the concept art.</p>

<p class="rubric">Marks and Grid</p>
<p>The marks and grid are green or amber ASCII characters displayed on a low
resolution monochrome computer screen. E.g. individual pixels are
distinguishable. The marks in winning squares blink on and off.</p>
<p>A blinking cursor is shown when players mouse hover over a empty squares.
The cursor is the full width and height of a character, e.g like the modern
insert cursor. A cliché beeping sound FX is played when squares are placed.</p>
<p>When the environment loads in non-speedrun mode each line of ASCII text is
drawn as if the game was being loaded over a 300 baud modem.</p>
<p class="rubric">Background Scenery</p>
<p>The background is a monochrome computer monitor with the an off white bezel
and red LED near the power button. The background color is dark green or
dark amber with perhaps the dark pixels still visible.</p>

<p>The marks and grid are created from pastel sidewalk chalk. The lines are
thick and hand drawn with similar animations as the <em>Notebook Paper and Pencil</em>
environment.</p>
<p>Pastel colors include red, blue, yellow, pink, green, and orange. The X, O,

<p class="rubric">Marks and Grid</p>
<p>The marks and grid are drawn from a quill pen with deliberate, fancy strokes.
Thick black ink is used. The grind lines and marks are precise but the
stroke pressure varies as the mark is being made, thus the lines are thinner
near the starting and ending points.</p>
<p>Creating of the marks and grid are animated. A line is drawn through the
winning squares.</p>
<p class="rubric">Background Scenery</p>
<p>The marks and grid are drawn on a faded tan papyrus paper. The paper’s rough
texture is clearly visible.</p>
<p>The tic-tac-toe game could be part of a scroll or book. E.g. there is Latin
text and one of those fancy first characters of the paragraph.</p>
<p class="rubric">Music Theme</p>

<p class="rubric">Marks and Grid</p>
<p>The marks and grid are scratched into the bathroom stall divider. This
reveals the metal underneath the paint. Each scratch is a fairly straight
line but it takes several attempts to form a line thus there are “whiskers”
hanging off the lines. The O marks are especially problematic resulting in
malformed O’s.</p>
<p>A metal scraping sound FX is played when the marks are being created.</p>
<p>A line is scratched through the winning marks.</p>
<p class="rubric">Background Scenery</p>
<p>The background is a pail blue, green, or gray stall divider. There is
additional graffiti written in ink or scratched into the paint that one
would find in a truck stop bathroom. Nothing inappropriate but adults should
find it funny.</p>
<p class="rubric">Music Theme</p>
<p>Truck stop music; perhaps a country vibe.</p>
<p class="rubric">Additional Details</p>
<p>There is bathroom humor a Easter egg in this environment. A “straining”
sound FX is played after a minute or two; past the length of a typical game.
Think of that one scene from Austin Powers. The situation becomes more
desperate as time goes on. Finally it resolves itself with a large plop /
splash sound and a big sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The marks and lines are glyphs carved into rock with glowing light coming
from the glyphs.</p>
<p>At first there is a grid, X, and O carvings in the rock. Mouse hovering over
a free square causes some mild blue illumination. Placing the mark results
in brighter illumination and the surrounding grid to illuminate too.</p>
<p>When the game ends in a win, the wining marks illuminate very brightly and
even change color. The grid takes on a uniform illumination. A cats game or
single player loss results in the grid to go dark and all the marks to go
back to a mild illumination, as if the power has been cut and they are
slowly fading away.</p>

<p class="rubric">Marks and Grid</p>
<p>The marks and grid are made up of simple clean lines. The marks are solid
red or blue. The grid is solid gray in color. Animations are not used or
used lightly.</p>
<p>A line is drawn through the winning marks. The line is the same color as
the marks.</p>
<p class="rubric">Background Scenery</p>
<p>The game is being played on a smart phone that is rotated 90 degrees. The
background of the play area is solid white.</p>
<p>Additionally. the phone’s bezel, speaker, and status bar are all visible.
The status bar includes signal level, power level, and time on the right
side. The left contains annoying advertisements that advertise fictional
products, poke fun at data stealing apps, and promote the other environments
in the game. The advertisements are rotated 90 degrees like the phone.</p>
<p class="rubric">Music Theme</p>
<p>Casual</p>
<p class="rubric">Additional Details</p>
<p>There is an Easter egg opportunity with the advertisements where clicking on
one advertising a different level switches the environment to that level.</p>
