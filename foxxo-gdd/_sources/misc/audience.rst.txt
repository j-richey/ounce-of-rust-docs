Target Audience
###############
FoxXO is targeted at casual gamers. There are three general groups that
might find the game interesting: new PC gamers, bored adults and modders.

=============
New PC Gamers
=============
FoxXO can be played by young or older players that do not have much PC
gaming experience. The game requires basic strategy and has simple inputs. As
players become more comfortable with the game mechanics they can try

====================
Players Filling Time
====================
Office workers or people stuck on an airplane can play FoxXO to make
the time pass. The regular game modes do not demand much attention so players
can let their minds wonder while playing. The variety of environments should
keep players entertained for at least a little while.

===================================
Computer Science Students / Modders
===================================
FoxXO is open source and is developed so that others can add their own
environments or extend the game. FoxXO is a simple, but non-trivial
application where people learning to program might find it an interesting
codebase to examine.
