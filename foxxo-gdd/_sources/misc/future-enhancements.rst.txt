Future Enhancements
###################

There are some additional features that can be considered for future versions of
the game. These are described below.


===================
Network Multiplayer
===================
Network based multiplayer allows players to remotely battle each other. Network
based multiplayer is preferable to local multiplayer in many situations such as
friends who live in different states, office environments, or players trying to
avoid a zombie apocalypse. [#covid19]_

There are different network multiplayer modes.

Normal
    The normal mode is :ref:`ref-gameplay-two-player-mode` but played over the
    network instead of locally.

Speedrun
    Speedrun multiplayer is a two player version of :ref:`ref-gameplay-speed-run-mode`
    where the players compete to see who can play 10 games the fastest without
    loosing. If a player wins one of the games, the speed run is over and that
    player is the winner. If all ten games are cat games, then the player with
    the fastest overall time wins.

King of the Hill
    King of the hill allows more than two people to battle. From the pool of
    available players two are chosen to battle. The round consists of playing
    two games. The player first to win any game, or in the case of all cat's
    games has the fastest overall time, wins the round. They stay in the game
    and another challenger is selected from the pool of players. This continues
    until a victory condition is met, such as the first player to win X number
    of rounds.

Regardless of the mode, the players always see the same environment to ensure
a consistent play experience.


============
Achievements
============
Achievements provide players goals outside the usual :doc:`../gameplay` rules.
These provide more depth to the game and encourage players to try different
approaches to the game.

A future enhancement is to add achievements to the game. Some achievement might
include the following.

* Win a game
* Play a game in every environment
* Win a hard game
* Win a game on every environment
* Win a hard game on every environment
* Complete a speed run
* Complete a speed run in less than X seconds
* Complete a speed run in less than 1 second!!


=======================
Additional Environments
=======================
A major focus of FoxXO is the ability to play tic-tac-toe in a variety
of :doc:`../environments`. Future versions of the game can add even more
environments. Some environments to consider are listed below.

* Lasers. Perhaps a laser cutter or some other use of lasers.
* Shower door or bathroom mirror.
* Futuristic dystopian or cyber punk theme.
* Some playgrounds have a 3x3 grid of squares for playing tic-tac-toe.
* Winter / snow / frozen lake theme.
* Food theme.
* Light board, like those found in ships or submarines.
* OXO oscilloscope throwback theme.
* Metal or glass forge with lots of glowing hot liquids.
* Clone of James' 2004 Tic Tac Toe.
