Environments
############
One of the main defining features of FoxXO over other tic-tac-toe games is the
use of multiple environments. Each environment has a strong visual theme and
complementary soundtrack. [#hiddenfox]_


=====================
Environment Selection
=====================
Each game takes place on a different environment. Environments are selected using
a shuffling algorithm. [#shuffelalgorithms]_ This ensures players get to
experience each environment in a random order.


====================
List of Environments
====================
This section lists each of the games environments.



..  _ref-environment-blueprint:

---------
Blueprint
---------


..  figure:: img/concept-art/blueprint.*
    :height: 288px

    Concept art for the Blueprint environment.

..  rubric:: Marks and Grid

The blueprint uses white text for the marks and white lines for the grid.

The grid can actually be a series of empty boxes but using thicker interior
lines.

Hovering over an empty square shows a dotted version of what would be drawn
there. Clicking places the mark without further animation.

Winning the game causes a "Winning Marks" label to be placed with arrows
pointing to the corresponding marks.


..  rubric:: Background Scenery

The background is predominantly deep blue. Additional, details are included
in white.

There is a title block with the game's name, author, version number, etc.

Measurement lines indicate the unit less distance between features.

The grid, squares, marks, etc are pointed to by arrows with labels.
Additional notes describe the music being played or point out the key
bindings.


..  rubric:: Music Theme

Background or thinking music.


..  rubric:: Additional Details

This environment provides an opportunity to point out features of the game
that might be overlooked by players such as keyboard support.

This environment makes a template when creating new environments. This is
due to it literally being a blueprint.






..  _ref-environment-notebook-paper-and-pencil:

-------------------------
Notebook Paper and Pencil
-------------------------


..  figure:: img/concept-art/paper.*
    :height: 288px

    Concept art for the Notebook Paper and Pencil environment.

..  rubric:: Marks and Grid

The marks and grid are dark graphite from a \#2 pencil. Each mark is
slightly different and the grid lines are not perfectly straight to give
it a hand drawn look. Likewise, mark placement is animated like one writing
an X or O while a corresponding pencil sound FX is played.

A line is drawn through the winning marks.


..  rubric:: Background Scenery

The background consists of notebook or engineering paper. Notebook paper is
white with gray or blue lines. Often times there also a vertical red margin
line.

Engineering paper us yellow with gray grid lines.


..  rubric:: Music Theme

Mild background music.






..  _ref-environment-pen-on-scrap-paper:

------------------
Pen on Scrap Paper
------------------



..  rubric:: Marks and Grid

The marks and grid are created from blue or red ink. Like the
*Notebook Paper and Pencil* environment, each mark is hand drawn with
corresponding animations and sound FX.

A line is drawn through the winning marks.


..  rubric:: Background Scenery

Various bits of scrap paper are used for the background. This can include
but is not limited to bank deposit slip, various store receipts, or any
other paper someone might have in their purse.

Text on the paper should be gray, faded black, or otherwise not interfere
with the visibility of the marks.


..  rubric:: Music Theme

Something with a gospel / churchy vibe


..  rubric:: Additional Details

The mark / grid color and the background image is randomly selected each
time the environment is played. Blue and red ink is used so the marks stand
out from the

The inspiration from this environment comes from me not paying attention in
church and drawing on scrap paper my mom happened to have.






..  _ref-environment-neon-lights:

-----------
Neon Lights
-----------


..  figure:: img/concept-art/neon.*
    :height: 288px

    Concept art for the Neon Lights environment.

..  rubric:: Marks and Grid

The marks and grid are created from luminescent orange, pink and / or blue
neon lights. Selecting a square causes the mark to illuminate with a
flickering animation and an electric buzzing sound FX.

All winning marks flash on and off with a mild electric buzz sound FX.

When the environment first loads in non-speedrun mode the lights are not
illuminated. Then the grid flickers on as if the transformer is starting to
fail.


..  rubric:: Background Scenery

The background is a brick wall holding the neon lights. Ideally, the wall is
illuminated by the lights. E.g. when a mark is selected the brick wall behind
the mark gains some illumination as shown in the concept art.

resolution monochrome computer screen. E.g. individual pixels are
distinguishable. The marks in winning squares blink on and off.

A blinking cursor is shown when players mouse hover over a empty squares.
The cursor is the full width and height of a character, e.g like the modern
insert cursor. A clich√© beeping sound FX is played when squares are placed.

When the environment loads in non-speedrun mode each line of ASCII text is
drawn as if the game was being loaded over a 300 baud modem.

-----------------------------------
Papyrus Paper and Fancy Calligraphy
-----------------------------------



..  rubric:: Marks and Grid

The marks and grid are drawn from a quill pen with deliberate, fancy strokes.
Thick black ink is used. The grind lines and marks are precise but the
stroke pressure varies as the mark is being made, thus the lines are thinner
near the starting and ending points.

Creating of the marks and grid are animated. A line is drawn through the
winning squares.


..  rubric:: Background Scenery

The marks and grid are drawn on a faded tan papyrus paper. The paper's rough
texture is clearly visible.

The tic-tac-toe game could be part of a scroll or book. E.g. there is Latin
text and one of those fancy first characters of the paragraph.


..  rubric:: Music Theme

Snooty classical music.






..  _ref-environment-bathroom-stall:

--------------
Bathroom Stall
--------------



..  rubric:: Marks and Grid

The marks and grid are scratched into the bathroom stall divider. This
reveals the metal underneath the paint. Each scratch is a fairly straight
line but it takes several attempts to form a line thus there are "whiskers"
hanging off the lines. The O marks are especially problematic resulting in
malformed O's.

A metal scraping sound FX is played when the marks are being created.

A line is scratched through the winning marks.


..  rubric:: Background Scenery

The background is a pail blue, green, or gray stall divider. There is
additional graffiti written in ink or scratched into the paint that one
would find in a truck stop bathroom. Nothing inappropriate but adults should
find it funny.

Truck stop music; perhaps a country vibe.


..  rubric:: Additional Details

There is bathroom humor a Easter egg in this environment. A "straining"
sound FX is played after a minute or two; past the length of a typical game.

desperate as time goes on. Finally it resolves itself with a large plop /
splash sound and a big sigh of relief.

-------------------
Ancient Alien Ruins
-------------------



..  rubric:: Marks and Grid

The marks and lines are glyphs carved into rock with glowing light coming
from the glyphs.

At first there is a grid, X, and O carvings in the rock. Mouse hovering over
a free square causes some mild blue illumination. Placing the mark results
in brighter illumination and the surrounding grid to illuminate too.

When the game ends in a win, the wining marks illuminate very brightly and
even change color. The grid takes on a uniform illumination. A cats game or
single player loss results in the grid to go dark and all the marks to go
back to a mild illumination, as if the power has been cut and they are
slowly fading away.

A strange alien sound FX is used when marks are placed.


..  rubric:: Background Scenery

The background is gray rock that would be found in a cave deep in the jungle.
There are various glyphs carved into the rock. There might even be some moss,
vines, or other deep green plants on the rock.
