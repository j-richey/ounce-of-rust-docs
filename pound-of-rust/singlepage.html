<h2><span class="section-number">1.2. </span>Scope of the Game<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-of-the-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tic Tac Toe is a game of strategy where two players, X and O, take turns placing
their mark in a 3 x 3 gird. The first player to get three marks in a row,
column, or diagonal wins the game.</p>
<p>This version of Tic Tac Toe is an unique take on the classic game. Players of
all ages battle the computer or each other in a variety of stunning environments.
Each environment tells part of the story of Tic Tac Toe from the past, present,
and future. Each environment has a strong visual theme and complementary
soundtrack.</p>
<p>Tic Tac Toe is fee, open source, no contains no annoying advertisements. It
opens runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The game launches Summer 2020.</p>

<p>Creation of the Tic Tac Toe game described in this document is part of the
Pound of Rust project. This section describes the project’s objectives.</p>
<div class="section" id="create-tic-tac-toe-game-with-rust">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.1. </span>Create Tic Tac Toe Game with Rust<a class="headerlink" href="#create-tic-tac-toe-game-with-rust" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main deliverable of this project is the Tic Tac Toe game for Windows, Mac,
and Linux. This project is the follow-up to the Ounce of Rust project <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#ounceofrust" id="id2">2</a>
that resulted in the creation of a Rust based Tic Tac Toe logic library,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open_ttt_lib</span></code>. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#opentttlib" id="id3">3</a></p>
<p>In addition to creating a fun game, the project provides more hand on experience
using Rust and is a showcase for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open_ttt_lib</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="provide-free-of-charge-and-under-an-open-source-license">

<p>Tic Tac Toe and all future releases of the game are free, open source, and
contain no advertisements or trackers. The game is released under a permissive
open source license and its code is available from a public repository
such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Many of today’s games casual games are released for free, but include
questionable monetization models such as microtransactions, pay-to-win schemes,
advertisements, and personal data harvesters. Tic Tac Toe stands apart from
these games by respecting player’s who choose to spend their valuable time
playing the game.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.3. </span>Release by RustConf 2020<a class="headerlink" href="#release-by-rustconf-2020" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Tic Tac Toe’s initial release is scheduled to coincide with RustConf 2020
on August 21, 2020. RustConf is the annual Rust developers conference; since
Tic Tac Toe is developed in Rust this makes an excellent time to launch a Rust
based game. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#rustconf" id="id4">4</a></p>
<p>To help meet the target release date, the initial release of the game might
contain a subset of the environments described in this document.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.4. </span>Easily Expandable and Modifiable<a class="headerlink" href="#easily-expandable-and-modifiable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Playing Tic Tac Toe in a variety of environments is a large part of what sets
this version of Tic Tac Toe apart from others. The game is designed such that
developers can easily add new environments. This allows developers to focus
their time and efforts creating stunning environments. Additionally, this
lowers the barrier of entry for users who are interested in modifying the game.
Finally, this allows quick turnaround of future releases of the game.</p>
<p>Automated tools, guides, checklists, and detailed documentation are some ways
that can help development speed.</p>

<h3><span class="section-number">1.4.5. </span>Build Risk Reduction Prototype<a class="headerlink" href="#build-risk-reduction-prototype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The development team creating Tic Tac Toe is new to the Rust programming language
and the available Rust libraries for game development. To help mitigate this
risk, a throwaway prototype game is created early in the project that explores
various technical aspects.</p>
<p>Using the lessons learned from the prototype also helps the development team
design a code base that is easily expandable and modifiable per the above
objective.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.1. </span>Rules of Tic Tac Toe<a class="headerlink" href="#rules-of-tic-tac-toe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tic Tac Toe is a game of strategy where two players, X and O, take turns placing
their mark in a 3 x 3 gird. The rules for Tic Tac Toe used for each game mode
are as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Play occurs on a board composed of a 3 x 3 grid of squares. The board starts
empty with no marks.</p></li>
<li><p>The first player places their mark in one of the grid’s squares. Traditionally,
the mark is the letter <em>X</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>The second player places their mark in one of the grid’s empty squares. A square
that already contains a mark cannot be updated or altered. Traditionally, the
second player uses the letter <em>O</em> as their mark.</p></li>
<li><p>Turns alternate between the players until the game is over.</p></li>
<li><p>The first player to get three of their marks in a line wins the game.
That is: they have three marks in a row, column, or diagonally.
Examples of winning games are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-example-wining-games"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 2.1</span></a>.</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id2">

that contributed to the win. Notice that it is possible to get multiple
sets of three marks in a row.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>The game ends in a draw, known as a <span class="target" id="index-0"></span>cat’s game, if no more empty
squares remain and a player has failed to get three marks in a line.
Examples of cat’s games are shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-example-cats-games"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 2.2</span></a>.</p>

to get three marks in a line.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>The steps above are repeated for a series of games. The starting player
alternates between games, that is the second game player <em>O</em> gets to make
the first move.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-player-mode">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.2. </span>One Player Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#one-player-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In one player mode the player battles a computer controlled opponent. There are
three difficulty settings: <strong>easy</strong>, <strong>medium</strong>, and <strong>hard</strong>.</p>
<p>Easy difficulty is targeted at players who are new to Tic Tac Toe and/or
computer games. The computer picks random squares allowing players to learn the
game’s controls and rules.</p>
<p>Medium difficulty is for players who have some experience with Tic Tac Toe. The
computer provides a challenge to the player but games are still winnable.</p>
<p>At hard difficulty the computer plays almost perfect games. The player must
capitalize on rare mistakes made by the computer to win. This is the recommended
difficulty for experienced Tic Tac Toe players.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-player-mode">
<h2><span class="section-number">2.3. </span>Two Player Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#two-player-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In two player mode two players take turns placing their marks according to the
rules described above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="speedrun-mode">
<span id="ref-gameplay-speed-run-mode"></span><h2><span class="section-number">2.4. </span>Speedrun Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#speedrun-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A speedrun mode provides an additional challenge for experienced players.
Players battle a flawless computer opponent through 10 environments completing
the games as fast as possible. At the end of the run the total time is
displayed along with the previous best times. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#timecalculation" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>The player is disqualified and the run halted if the player loses a game.
Since the computer opponent never makes a mistake, each game in the speedrun
ends in a cat’s game. In other words, each speedrun requires the same total
number of moves to complete.</p>
<p>Unnecessary animations are disabled in speedrun mode so they do not get in the
way of the speedup gameplay. Additionally, speedrun mode has its own dramatic
music that replaces the music tracks of each environment — environments are
played so fast there is not sufficient time to appreciate their individual sound
tracks.</p>

<p>This chapter describes the user interface of Tic Tac Toe. This includes the main
game board, controls, and all game menus.</p>
<div class="section" id="game-board">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.1. </span>Game Board<a class="headerlink" href="#game-board" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The game board is where players spend the majority of their time. Additionally,
the game loads directly to this view ensuring players get to gameplay as quickly
as possible without menus getting in the way. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#firstview" id="id1">1</a> A concept drawing of
the game board is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ui-game-board"><span class="std std-numref">Figure 3.1</span></a>.</p>

</div>
<p>The game board contains the following items of interest:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The marks and grid. The appearance of these depend on the current environment
being played. However, the marks for all environments use the same center
point and have the same selectable hotspot. This ensures consistency between
environments when using the mouse.</p></li>
<li><p>The background of the game board depends on the current environment.</p></li>
<li><p>The hamburger button opens the <a class="reference internal" href="#ref-ui-main-menu"><span class="std std-ref">Main Menu</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Status text indicates who gets to make the next move and the outcome of
the game. Once the game is over buttons to play the next game or return to
the menu also appear in this area. The text is outlined or shaded such that
it is visible over any possible background.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A major focus of the game is playing Tic Tac Toe in variety of stunning
environments that control how the marks, grid, and background look. Thus, a
minimalist approach is used for the game board view. The only UI widgets are a
menu button and some status text.</p>

</div>
<p>Items of interest are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The speedrun status display prominently shows the elapsed time of the run.
This helps give the player a sense of urgency and lets them see if they are
on track to get a best time.</p></li>
<li><p>Splits for each game are additionally displayed. Dashes or other marks are
used for games that have yet to be played. This allows players to quickly
visually gauge how many games remain.</p></li>
<li><p>Opening the game’s menu ends the run. The run is disqualified.</p></li>
<li><p>Status text indicates the current turn. If the player loses a game, the
status text notes that the run is disqualified and the player is invited
to try the run again or return to the Speedrun menu. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#speedrunloss" id="id2">2</a></p></li>

<p>The game is directly distributed to players via the internet. There are two main
ways to acquire a copy of the game: downloading an platform specific package, or
building the game from source.</p>
<div class="section" id="platform-packages">
<h4><span class="section-number">5.3.2.1. </span>Platform Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#platform-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Platform specific packages can be downloaded from the game’s website.
In particular, Windows users expect an installer to install the game on their
system. They do not have readily access to compilers or other tools to build
software from source. Finally, Windows is the most widely used operating system
so a Windows installer is a requirement for this project to be successful.</p>
<p>Linux and Mac users have easier access to compilers but they still appreciate
packages for their convenience. Packages for these platforms are created on a
best effort basis.</p>
