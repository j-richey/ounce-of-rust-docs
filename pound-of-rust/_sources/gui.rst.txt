This chapter describes the user interface of Tic Tac Toe. This includes the main
game board, controls, and all game menus.


==========
Game Board
==========
The game board is where players spend the majority of their time. Additionally,
the game loads directly to this view ensuring players get to gameplay as quickly
as possible without menus getting in the way. [#firstview]_ A concept drawing of
the game board is shown in :numref:`fig-ui-game-board`.

..  _fig-ui-game-board:
..  figure:: img/ui/game-board.*

    Game board concept drawing.

The game board contains the following items of interest:

1.  The marks and grid. The appearance of these depend on the current environment
    being played. However, the marks for all environments use the same center
    point and have the same selectable hotspot. This ensures consistency between
    environments when using the mouse.
2.  The background of the game board depends on the current environment.
3.  The hamburger button opens the :ref:`ref-ui-main-menu`.
4.  Status text indicates who gets to make the next move and the outcome of
    the game. Once the game is over buttons to play the next game or return to
    the menu also appear in this area. The text is outlined or shaded such that
    it is visible over any possible background.

A major focus of the game is playing Tic Tac Toe in variety of stunning
environments that control how the marks, grid, and background look. Thus, a
minimalist approach is used for the game board view. The only UI widgets are a
menu button and some status text.

..  _ref-ui-speedrun-game-board:

--------
Speedrun
--------
Additional UI widgets are added to the game board to facilitate speedrun mode.
:numref:`fig-ui-speedrun-game-board` shows the speedrun gameboard.

..  _fig-ui-speedrun-game-board:
..  figure:: img/ui/speedrun-game-board.*

    Speedrun game board concept drawing.

Items of interest are:

1.  The speedrun status display prominently shows the elapsed time of the run.
    This helps give the player a sense of urgency and lets them see if they are
    on track to get a best time.
2.  Splits for each game are additionally displayed. Dashes or other marks are
    used for games that have yet to be played. This allows players to quickly
    visually gauge how many games remain.
3.  Opening the game's menu ends the run. The run is disqualified.
4.  Status text indicates the current turn. If the player loses a game, the
    status text notes that the run is disqualified and the player is invited
    to try the run again or return to the Speedrun menu. [#speedrunloss]_

When a game is competed successfully the next game starts immediately allowing
players to go as fast as possible through the games.

..  rubric:: Footnotes

..  [#firstview] The loaded game is a single-player game using the last
        difficulty and player mark settings. The defaults for these are Medium
        difficulty and X marks.
..  [#speedrunloss] If the player loses a speedrun game, the board remains
        visible so the player can see where they made mistakes. This allows them
        to adjust their strategy for next time.
..  [#localhelp] The :ref:`ref-objective-free-of-charge` objective mentions not
        tracking players. Websites often contain trackers, advertisements, and
        other items that violate this objective.
